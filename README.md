- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pandamanical! I studied a Sociology undergraduate degree and an MSc in Cybersecurity and I'm learning more of the ropes in networking, programming and computer architecture!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in hardware security and Python programming! I'm developing my skillset at the moment and picking up the basics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python coding, some simple scripting to compliment Masters Degree experience! :)
